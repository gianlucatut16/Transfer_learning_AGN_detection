# Transfer_learning_AGN_detection
In this repository a code for my master thesis. The data is a repository with images of galaxies taken in different times. There's a first step of feature extraction with a pre-trained CNN (transfer learning)  and the second step was about giving these features as input for a Nearest Neighbor algorithm in order to get a binary classification.
